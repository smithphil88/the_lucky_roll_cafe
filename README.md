## Introduction

The focus of this site was to implement the django framework and python on the back-end in order to create a user-friendly site. The site is a board game cafe site, where the user is able to create, edit and delete a user account along with the ability to book a specific type of table dependent on the users needs. As per the scope of the project, CRUD (create, read, update and delete) ideology was followed and the user is able to edit and delete their booking if they so wish to. The site has an admin panel for the business owner to allow messages to be sent by the user for any additional requests (table location, food requirements etc.)

## User-Stories

## Design

The idea behind the design for the site was simplicity and functionality presented in an appealing and intuitive manner. Users who would be brought to the site are likely to know what they want and the design encourages them to use the site. Navigation throughout the site is intuitive with functions such as being able to access the nav-bar at all times and having messages appear to let them know a certain request has been successful or unsuccessful.
