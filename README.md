## Introduction

The focus of this site was to implement the django framework and python on the back-end in order to create a user-friendly site. The site is a board game cafe site, where the user is able to create, edit and delete a user account along with the ability to book a specific type of table dependent on the users needs. As per the scope of the project, CRUD (create, read, update and delete) ideology was followed and the user is able to edit and delete their booking if they so wish to.
